# tRPC UI
I like using [tRPC Panel](https://github.com/iway1/trpc-panel) during development. It is however not compatible with tRPC v11 and appears to no longer be actively maintained. Whilst trying to implement a quick way to make it work with v11 I concluded that the current codebase does a ton of work that's no longer needed with v11. I therefore decided to build my own attempt at a similar library, mostly as a learning exercise. 

## Status
Currently in active development. Absolutely not worth using yet.
